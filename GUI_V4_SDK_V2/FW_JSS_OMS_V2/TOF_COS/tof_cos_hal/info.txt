This folder contains HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) drivers needed by the TOFCOS library. 

If a certain hardware is only needed by the TOFCOS, the drivers may just be placed in this folder.

If a hardware is needed by the TOFCOS and the application (e.g. I2C), an intermediated driver can be placed here to encacsulate the HW access of the TOFCOS.
